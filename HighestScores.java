COSC 1336
Programming Assignment 5

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the 
number of students and each studentâ€™s name and score 
and finally displays the student with the highest 
score and the student with the second highest score.  
Use the next() method in the Scanner class to read a 
name, rather than using the nextLine() method.  
Assume that the number of students is at least 2
